- decidability results [Bonchi+] on critical pair analysis
- critical pair analysis:
  1. enumerate critical pairs
  2. check if they are all joinable
- we do the first part
- motivation: why do we care with wiring diagrams?
  - automaton rewriting (NFA to DFA)
  - lambda-calculus?
  - the art of programming
- adding interfaces for dealing with undecidability
- see plump on decidabilit of critical pair analysis

* What are we doing: describing an algorithm for enumerating critical-pairs in string-diagram DPO rewriting systems, which involves giving algorithms for the assumptions in plump p. 15
* Why are we doing it: it's the first step of a critical pair analysis for deciding confluence
* Why is confluence of string diagrams relevant: string diagram rewriting can be used for lots of things, and confluence is necessary for [â€¦] (see anna and innocent's post, also plump's paper)
